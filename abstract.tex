A comparison of differing simulation platforms for a waste heat recovery system is completed. This is with specific reference to the Integrated heat pump/organic Rankine cycle system. The comparison is directly within the bounds of the simulation system and does not include any optimisation improvements. The comparison is carried out with the goal of comparing free and expensive software. Information is gathered with regards to the system to allow for simulation of the system.
